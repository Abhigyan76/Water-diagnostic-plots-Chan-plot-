# Water-diagnostic-plots(Chan-plots)

Used the open source data as well as synthetic data.

**Objective**
Reservoir engineer have to deal with water control diagnostic plots manually , to get the idea of current and remaining production potential of the well. But it is very tedious process and predicting the correct pattern after that.

So, I have made a model that can predict the type of pattern( Constant WOR, Normal Displacement  , Chanelling , Multilayer Chanelling) using the dataset having rate of oil per month , rate of water per month and time.
